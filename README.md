# Temperature Controlled Fan
## Purpose:
The purpose of this temperature controlled fan is to keep an object or area at a cool temperature. On a larger scale this could be used to maintain the temperature of a medium size room to a desirable temperature. For example an automatic ceiling fan. On a smaller scale this could be used to keep the temperature of an electronic object at a safe temperature by cooling it down when it starts to heat. Another application for this project is a handheld device for personal use when it is hot. You could clip it to your baby stroller to keep a baby cool,  clip it on your car mirror to keep you cool, etc. 
## Functionality:
This fan has a button that turns the system on and off. When the system is turned on the temperature sensor monitors the temperature. If the temperature rises over 80.0 degrees Fahrenheit the fan will turn on until the temperature drops below 80.0 degrees Fahrenheit. WHen the fan is on the ultrasonic sensor measures the distance of objects near the fan. If the object gets within 5 cm of the fan then a speaker will make a sound until the object moves further than 5 cm away. At the same time, a red LED light will blink on and off every 500ms.
